## 🧠 IBM Granite Usage

We use IBM’s `granite3.2:8b` model locally via **Ollama**. Prompt text is piped to the model using `subprocess.Popen`. The AI:

* Understands plain email text
* Summarizes and structures content
* Returns output directly to the UI

IBM Granite gives us trusted, open-source LLM capabilities **without requiring cloud calls** – ideal for sensitive emails.
